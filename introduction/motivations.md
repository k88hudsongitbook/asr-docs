# Motivations

AS Router is a project designed to provide a secure and flexible in-product messaging mechanism for Firefox Desktop and ultimately to provide **a unified system for communicating with users in Firefox Desktop** in an intelligent, effective, secure, highly targeted and data-driven manner.

We want to enhance or replace our relatively "brute-force" attempts to communicate with users such as:
* snippets
* onboarding
* addon recommendations
* product updates

with highly-tailored contextual and targeted experiences, while also enforcing standard UX guidelines, best practices around privacy and security, and data-driven experimentation to help guide our efforts in the future.
